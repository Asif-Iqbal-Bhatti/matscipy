def mic(dr, cell, pbc=None):
    """
    Apply minimum image convention to an array of distance vectors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dr : array_like
        Array of distance vectors.
    cell : array_like
        Simulation cell.
    pbc : array_like, optional
        Periodic boundary conditions in x-, y- and z-direction. Default is to
        assume periodic boundaries in all directions.

    Returns
    -------
    dr : array
        Array of distance vectors, wrapped according to the minimum image
        convention.

    # periodic boundaries then and need to be unwrapped.

def neighbour_list(a, cutoff):

    Compute a neighbour list for an atomic configuration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ase.Atoms
        Atomic configuration.
    cutoff : float
        Cutoff for neighbour search.

    Returns
    -------
    i, j : array_like
        Neighbour pairs as indices to the atoms.
