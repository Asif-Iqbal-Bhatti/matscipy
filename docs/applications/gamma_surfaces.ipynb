    "# Generating Gamma Surfaces & Stacking Faults\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma surfaces (also called generalised stacking faults) and stacking faults are forms of crystal defects formed by sliding two slabs of a crystal against each other along a given plane. Often, these defects have metastable states (also called stacking faults), which can exist at grain boundaries or between two partial dislocations. Here, we deal with the full pathway from a complete crystal, sliding through any metastable points until we return back to the perfect crystal again. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a stacking fault, the slabs are moved along a single line, whereas for gamma surfaces this is the full plane (hence generalised stacking fault). `matscipy.gamma_surface` provides two classes - `GammaSurface` and `StackingFault` - in order to model these systems, including utility methods for relaxing and plotting the associated potential energy surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stacking Faults for a Specific Dislocation\n",
    "When modelling systems of dissociated dislocations connected by a stacking fault, it can be useful to see the stacking fault in isolation. To do this, we will use `matscipy.gamma_surface.StackingFault` to model the stacking fault associated with the dissociated `matscipy.dislocations.DiamondGlideScrew` dislocation in Carbon. \n",

    "We will first use a potential by  to obtain reasonable guesses for a lattice parameter and elastic constants, and take a look at the dissociated `DiamondGlideScrew` dislocation:"

Here, we have more choices to make, mainly through which constraints we apply to the images, which are controlled by the arguments `constrain_atoms` and `cell_relax`. As the name suggests, `constrain_atoms` adds atomic constraints, which restrict the atoms to only relax in the Z direction (towards or away from the stacking fault). The `cell_relax` argument allows the length of the cell in Z (`image.cell[2, 2]`) to be relaxed.\n",
