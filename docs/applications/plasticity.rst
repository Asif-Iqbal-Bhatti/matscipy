Plasticity
==========

For large loads, solids can respond with irreversible deformation. One form of irreversibility is plasticity, that is carried by extended defects, the dislocations, in crystals. The module :mod:`matscipy.dislocation` implements tools for studying structure and movement of dislocations. Construction and analysis of model atomic systems is implemented for compact and dissociated screw, as well as edge dislocations in cubic crystals. The implementation supports ideal straight as well as kinked dislocations. Some of the dislocation functionality requires the `atomman` and/or `OVITO` packages as optional dependencies.
