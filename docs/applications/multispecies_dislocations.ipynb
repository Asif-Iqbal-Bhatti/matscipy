    "### Dislocations in Disordered Systems\n",
    "Generating dislocation structures for systems which have some chemical disorder is also possible, with some caveats:\n",
    "1. The generation routines will only work reliably when given on-lattice bulk structures with cubic cells\n",
    "2. The generated structure is based on a periodic replication of the base unit_cell, thus won't have true disorder\n",
    "3. The displacement field applied to the bulk structure does not depend on atomic species - known lattice distortions caused by the disorder will not be captured\n",
    "4. The current code only allows $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$ to be specified, so more complex elastic effects (E.G. $C_{11} \\neq C_{22}$) cannot currently be captured\n",
    "\n",
    "With these in mind, a recommended workflow would be to start by generating the dislocation system for an ordered system, but using the elastic constants of the disordered system. From there, the disorder can be applied by simply changing the chemcical symbols of the atoms to match the target composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show a worked example of this, consider the alloy $\\text{In}_{0.5} \\text{Ga}_{0.5} \\text{As}$. This should form a distorted Zincblende structure, where the In sites from the previous InP bulk are now 50% occupied by Ga, and all P sites are now In.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to model this, we can generate a dislocation for GaAs (which is very similar to the InP example above), but using the lattice constant and elastic properties of $\\text{In}_{0.5} \\text{Ga}_{0.5} \\text{As}$."
