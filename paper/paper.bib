	abstract = {The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

  abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van derWaals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files. The package is distributed as free software and can be downloaded from http://www.ime.unicamp.br/{$\sim$}martinez/packmol/. \textcopyright},

Contrary to previous studies on electrotunable lubrication that were carried out by fixing the charges, our simulations keep electrodes at fixed electrostatic potential using a variable charge method. For pure water and NaCl solutions, viscosity is independent of the polarization of the electrodes, but wall slip depends on the potential difference. Our findings are in agreement with previous analytical theories of how wall slip is affected by interatomic interactions. The simulations shed light on the role of electrode polarization for wall slip and illustrate a mechanism for controlling friction and nanoscale flow in simple aqueous lubricants.},

                   simulations. While conceptually simple, the treatment of
                   elastic constants is complicated by two factors not yet
                   having been concurrently discussed: finite-strain and

              concurrent multiscale technique that couples atomistic and
              discrete dislocation domains with the ability to pass
              dislocations seamlessly between domains. CADD has been
              demonstrated only in 2d plane-strain problems, for which each
              individual dislocation is either entirely atomistic or entirely
              discrete. Here, a full 3d implementation of CADD is presented,
              with emphasis on the algorithms for handling the description of
              dislocation lines that span both atomistic and continuum domains,
              so-called hybrid dislocations. The key new features of the method
              for 3d are (i) the use of an atomistic template of the
              dislocation core structure to transmit the proper atomistic
              environment of a continuum dislocation to the atomistic domain
              for hybrid dislocations and (ii) a staggered solution procedure
              enabling evolution of the hybrid dislocations. The method
              naturally requires calibration of discrete-dislocation Peierls
              stresses and mobilities to their atomistic values, implementation
              of a dislocation detection algorithm to identify atomistic
              dislocations, and computation of continuum dislocation
              displacement fields that provide boundary conditions for the
              atomistic problem. The method is implemented using the atomistic
              code LAMMPS and the discrete dislocation code ParaDiS within the
              LibMultiscale environment developed by the lead authors, and so
              has all the advantages of these widely-used high-performance
              open-source codes. Validation and application of CADD-3d are

              increase in the strength with a decreasing layer thickness.
              Pillars fail through the formation of shear bands whose
              nucleation they trace back to the existence of surface flaws.
              This combined approach demonstrates the crucial role of contact

               of atoms as a function of their coordinates. Their main
               application is the effective simulation of many-atom systems.
               Here, we review empirical interatomic potentials designed to
               reproduce elastic properties, defect energies, bond breaking,
               bond formation, and even redox reactions. We discuss popular
               two-body potentials, embedded-atom models for metals, bond-order
               potentials for covalently bonded systems, polarizable potentials
               including charge-transfer approaches for ionic systems and
               quantum-Drude oscillator models mimicking higher-order and
               many-body dispersion. Particular emphasis is laid on the
               question what constraints ensue from the functional form of a
               potential, e.g., in what way Cauchy relations for elastic tensor
               elements can be violated and what this entails for the ratio of
               defect and cohesive energies, or why the ratio of boiling to
               melting temperature tends to be large for potentials describing
               metals but small for short-ranged pair potentials. The review is
               meant to be pedagogical rather than encyclopedic. This is why we
               highlight potentials with functional forms sufficiently simple
               to remain amenable to analytical treatments. Our main objective
               is to provide a stimulus for how existing approaches can be

               simulations based on empirical potentials.",
