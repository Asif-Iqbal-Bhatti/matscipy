# Summary

Materials science at atomic scale including fracture mechanics, plasticity,  contact mechanics and electrochemistry.

# Statement of need

The python package `matscipy` contains a set of tools for researchers in a field of materials science and atomistic modelling. It is built around around Atomistic Simulation Environment (ASE) [@Larsen2017] that offers great flexibility and python interface to tens of atomistic simulation codes.
